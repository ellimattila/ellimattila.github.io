                    I’m a Master’s student in the Service Design and Engineering program at Aalto University, with a minor in USchool, which focuses on usability, user-centered design, and human-computer interaction. I completed my Bachelor's studies in Computer Science, which has given me a strong technical foundation.<br>
                    <br>
                    I’m particularly passionate about service design, enhancing user experiences, and creating intuitive interfaces, where creativity and problem-solving come together. I also enjoy coding, as it allows me to build tangible solutions and better understand how design decisions translate into implementation. I’m always eager to learn new things and take on challenges that push my skills further.<br>
